# Video2Blog
Actually, should have named it podcast to blog or fireside to blog, even conversation to blog would have been better.

Anyway! here is what we are trying to do here

1. Get the video, and sample it through diarization
2. Split the original file as per diarization
3. Use whisper to convert diarization segments to transcript - SPEAKER01 :
4. Weave all that together as big transcript
5. Ask ChatGPT to summarise it as blog, takeaways and key discussion pointers.
6. Use humans to improve the blogpost.
